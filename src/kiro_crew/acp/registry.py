"""Upstream ACP Registry — discovery and distribution for ACP adapters.

The registry (``https://cdn.agentclientprotocol.com/registry/v1/latest/registry.json``)
is the ecosystem's curated index of ACP adapters. It answers "which adapters exist,
what are they called, and how do I launch one". It deliberately does NOT answer
"can Kiro Crew govern this adapter's tool calls" — there is no permission,
approval or capability data in the schema — so this module owns exactly the half
the registry covers and nothing more. The trust half stays in
:mod:`kiro_crew.acp.backends`, keyed by the registry ``id``.

That split is the whole point of consuming the registry rather than hand-listing
adapters: the ecosystem is ~38 entries and growing, so a table of hand-written
rows goes stale by construction, while a routing verdict is a judgement Kiro Crew
must make itself and cannot inherit from anyone.

Schema (registry v1), one entry per adapter::

    id            "codex-acp"          registry identity; our descriptor key
    name          "Codex"              display name
    version       "1.4.0"              pinned release
    description   "ACP adapter for …"
    repository    "https://github.com/…"
    authors       ["OpenAI", …]
    license       "Apache-2.0"         "proprietary" for claude-acp
    distribution  {"npx": {"package": "@agentclientprotocol/codex-acp@1.4.0"}}
    icon          "https://cdn…/codex-acp.svg"

``distribution.npx.package`` carries an EXACT pinned version, which is the
ecosystem's canonical launch form. Kiro Crew still prefers an operator's own
install when one resolves, because an npx launch reaches the network on a cold
cache and a gateway spawning a session is the wrong moment to discover that.

Fetching is OPT-IN and cached on disk. Nothing here runs on the default kiro-cli
path: an operator who never opens the adapter surface never pays a network call,
and a gateway with no outbound access degrades to the bundled snapshot rather
than failing a session.
